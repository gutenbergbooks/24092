<h2><a name="CHARACTERISTICS" id="CHARACTERISTICS"></a>W. R. GREG: A SKETCH.</h2>

<p>
It is perhaps a little hard to undertake to write about
the personality of a thinker whose ideas one does not
share, and whose reading of the events and tendencies
of our time was in most respects directly opposite to
one's own. But literature is neutral ground. Character
is more than opinion. Here we may forget the loud
cries and sounding strokes, the watchwords and the
tactics of the tented field, and fraternise with the
adversary of the eve and the morrow in friendly
curiosity and liberal recognition. It fell to the present
writer at one time to have one or two bouts of public
controversy with Mr. Greg. In these dialectics Mr.
Greg was never vehement and never pressed, but he
was inclined to be&mdash;or, at least, was felt by an
opponent to be&mdash;dry, mordant, and almost harsh.
These disagreeable prepossessions were instantly
dissipated, as so often happens, by personal acquaintance.
He had not only the courtesy of the good type
of the man of the world, but an air of moral suavity,
when one came near enough to him, that was infinitely
attractive and engaging. He was urbane, essentially
modest, and readily interested in ideas and subjects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><a href="#TOC">[214]</a></span>
other than his own. There was in his manner and
address something of what the French call <i>liant</i>.
When the chances of residence made me his neighbour,
an evening in his drawing-room, or half an hour's talk
in casual meetings in afternoon walks on Wimbledon
Common, was always a particularly agreeable incident.
Some men and women have the quality of atmosphere.
The egotism of the natural man is surrounded by an
elastic medium. Mr. Greg was one of these personalities
with an atmosphere elastic, stimulating, elevating,
and yet composing. We do wrong to narrow
our interests to those only of our contemporaries who
figure with great lustre and <i>éclat</i> in the world. Some
of the quiet characters away from the centre of great
affairs are as well worth our attention as those who
in high-heeled cothurnus stalk across the foreground.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greg, it is not necessary to say, has a serious
reputation in the literature of our time. In politics
he was one of the best literary representatives of the
fastidious or pedantocratic school of government. In
economics he spoke the last word, and fell, sword in
hand, in the last trench, of the party of capitalist
supremacy and industrial tutelage. In the group of
profound speculative questions that have come up for
popular discussion since the great yawning rents and
fissures have been made in the hypotheses of theology
by the hypotheses of science, he set a deep mark on
many minds. 'We are in the sick foggy dawn of a
new era,' says one distinguished writer of our day,
'and no one saw more clearly than W. R. Greg what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><a href="#TOC">[215]</a></span>
the day that would follow was likely to be.' To this
I must humbly venture to demur; for there is no
true vision of the fortunes of human society without
Hope, and without Faith in the beneficent powers and
processes of the Unseen Time. That and no other is
the mood in which our sight is most likely to pierce
the obscuring mists from which the new era begins to
emerge. When we have said so much as this, it
remains as true as before that Mr. Greg's faculty of
disinterested speculation, his feeling for the problems
of life, and his distinction of character, all make it
worth while to put something about him on record,
and to attempt to describe him as he was, apart from
the opaque influences of passing controversy and of
discussions that are rapidly losing their point.
</p>

<p><a name="BORN_AT_MANCHESTER" id="BORN_AT_MANCHESTER"></a>
Mr. Greg was born at Manchester in 1809. The
family stock was Irish by residence and settlement,
though Scotch in origin. The family name was half
jocosely and half seriously believed to be the middle
syllable of the famous clan of Macgregor. William
Rathbone Greg's grandfather was a man of good
position in the neighbourhood of Belfast, who sent
two of his sons to push their fortunes in England.
The younger of the two was adopted by an uncle, who
carried on the business of a merchant at Manchester.
He had no children of his own. The boy was sent
to Harrow, where Dr. Samuel Parr was then an
assistant master. When the post of head master
became vacant, Parr, though only five-and-twenty,
entered into a very vehement contest for the prize.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><a href="#TOC">[216]</a></span>
He failed, and in a fit of spleen set up an establishment
of his own at Stanmore. Many persons, as De
Quincey tells us, of station and influence both lent
him money and gave him a sort of countenance
equally useful to his interests by placing their sons
under his care. Among those who accompanied him
from Harrow was Samuel Greg. The lad was meant
by his uncle to be a clergyman, but this project he
stoutly resisted. Instead of reading for orders he
travelled abroad, acquired foreign languages, and
found out something about the commercial affairs of
the continent of Europe. His uncle died in 1783,
and the nephew took up the business. It was the
date of the American Peace. Samuel Greg was
carried forward on the tide of prosperity that poured
over the country after that great event, and in a
moderate time he laid the foundation of a large and
solid fortune. The mighty industrial revolution that
was begun by the inventions of Arkwright was now
in its first stage. Arkwright's earliest patent had
been taken out a few years before, and his factory in
Derbyshire had by this time proved a practical
success. Instead of sharing the brutish animosity of
the manufacturers of Lancashire to the new processes
that were destined to turn their county into a mine
of gold, Greg discerned their immense importance.
The vast prospects of manufacturing industry grew
upon his imagination. He looked about him in search
of water-power in the neighbourhood of Manchester,
and at length found what he wanted a dozen miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><a href="#TOC">[217]</a></span>
away at Wilmslow, over the Cheshire border. Here
the stream of the Bollen cuts through a flat and
uninteresting table-land, and forms a pretty valley of
its own, as it winds between banks of red sandstone.
When the mill was built, and a house close to it,
Quarry Bank became the home of the family, and it
was here that W. R. Greg passed his childhood, youth,
and early manhood.
</p>

<p>
His mother was fifth in descent from Philip Henry,
one of the two thousand uncompromising divines who
were driven out from their benefices on that Black
Bartholomew's Day of 1662, which is still commemorated
by the severer Nonconformists of the old school.
His son was the better known <a name="MATHEW_HENRY_GREG" id="MATHEW_HENRY_GREG"></a>Mathew Henry, whose
famous commentary on the Bible has for more than a
century and a half been the favourite manual of
devotional reading in half the pious households all
over England and the United States. Something of
the Puritan element was thus brought into the family.
In Ireland the Gregs belonged to the Presbyterians
of the New Light, and their doctrine allowed of a
considerable relaxation in the rigours of older orthodoxy.
Many, again, of the Puritans of the North of
England had favoured the teachings of Priestley.
The result of these two streams of influence was that
the Gregs of Manchester joined the Unitarians. In
this body W. R. Greg was brought up. His mother
was a woman of strongly marked character. She was
cultivated, and had some literary capacity of her own;
she cared eagerly for the things of the mind, both for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><a href="#TOC">[218]</a></span>
herself and her children; and in spite of ill health and
abundant cares, she persisted in strenuous effort after
a high intellectual and moral standard. A little book
of Maxims compiled by her still remains; and she
found time to write a couple of volumes of <i>Practical
Suggestions towards alleviating the Sufferings of the Sick</i>.
One volume is little more than a selection of religious
extracts, not likely to be more apt or useful to the
sick than to the whole. The other is a discreet and
homely little manual of nursing, distinguished from
the common run of such books by its delicate consideration
and wise counsel for the peculiar mental
susceptibilities of the invalid. The collection of
Maxims and Observations was designed to be 'an
useful gift to her children, gleaned from her own
reading and reflection.' Though not intended for
publication, they found their way into a few congenial
circles, and one at least of those who were educated
at Dr. Carpenter's school at Bristol can remember
these maxims being read aloud to the boys, and the
impression that their wisdom and morality made upon
his youthful mind. The literary value of the compilation
is modest enough. Along with some of the
best of the sayings of Chesterfield, La Rochefoucauld,
Addison, and other famous masters of sentences, is
much that is nearer to the level of nursery commonplace.
But then these commonplaces are new truths
to the young, and they are the unadorned, unseen
foundations on which character is built.
</p>

<p>
The home over which this excellent woman presided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><a href="#TOC">[219]</a></span>
offered an ideal picture of domestic felicity and
worth. The grave simplicity of the household, their
intellectual ways, the absence of display and even of
knick-knacks, the pale blue walls, the unadorned furniture,
the well-filled bookcases, the portrait of George
Washington over the chimney-piece, all took people
back to a taste that was formed on Mrs. Barbauld
and Dr. Channing. Stanley, afterwards Bishop of
Norwich, and father of the famous Dean of our own
day, was rector of the adjoining parish of Alderley.
Catherine Stanley, his wife, has left a charming
memorial of the home of the Gregs.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been to Quarry Bank? It is such a
picture of rational, happy life. Mr. Greg is quite a
gentleman; his daughters have the delightful simplicity
of people who are perfectly satisfied in their place, and
never trying to get out of it. He is rich, and he
spends just as people do not generally spend their money,
keeping a sort of open house, without pretension. If he
has more guests than the old butler can manage, he has
his maid-servants in to wait. He seldom goes out, except
on journeys, so that with the almost certainty of finding
a family party at home, a large circle of connections, and
literary people, and foreigners, and Scotch and Irish, are
constantly dropping in, knowing they cannot come amiss.
You may imagine how this sort of life makes the whole
family sit loose to all the incumbrances and hindrances
of society. They actually do not know what it is to be
formal or dull: each with their separate pursuits and
tastes, intelligent and well-informed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mrs. Fletcher, again, that beautiful type of feminine
character alike as maiden and mother, whose autobiography
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><a href="#TOC">[220]</a></span>
was given to the world a few years ago,
tells how the family at Quarry Bank struck and
delighted her. 'We stayed a week with them,' she
says, 'and admired the cultivation of mind and refinement
of manners which Mrs. Greg preserved in the
midst of a money-making and somewhat unpolished
community of merchants and manufacturers. Mr.
Greg, too, was most gentlemanly and hospitable, and
surrounded by eleven clever and well-conducted
children. I thought them the happiest family group
I had ever seen.'<a name="FNanchor_220_1" id="FNanchor_220_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

<p>
Samuel Greg was one of thirteen children, and he
in his turn became the father of thirteen. W. R.
Greg was the youngest of them. The brightness and
sweetness of his disposition procured for him even
more than the ordinary endearment of such a place
in a large family. After the usual amount of schooling,
first at home under the auspices of an elder sister,
then at Leeds, and finally at Dr. Carpenter's at Bristol,
in the winter of 1826-1827 he went to the <a name="EDINBURGH_UNIVERSITY" id="EDINBURGH_UNIVERSITY"></a>University
of Edinburgh, and remained there until the end of the
session of 1828. He was a diligent student, but we
may suspect, from the turn of his pursuits on leaving
the university, that his mind worked most readily
out of the academic groove. After the manner of
most young men with an aptitude for literature, he
competed for a prize poem in John Wilson's class,
but he did not win. When he was in low spirits&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><a href="#TOC">[221]</a></span>
mood so much more common in early manhood than
we usually remember afterwards&mdash;he drove them
away by energetic bursts of work. On one occasion,
he says, 'When I was so bad that I thought I should
have gone distracted, I shut myself up, and for three
days studied all the most abstruse works that I could
find on the origin of government and society, such as
Godwin, Goguet, Rousseau, <i>et c&aelig;tera</i>, from seven in
the morning till twelve at night, which quite set me
up again.' 'Natural history,' at another time he tells
his sister, 'is my principal pursuit at present, and
from half-past six in the morning to twelve at night
I am incessantly at work, with the exception of about
two hours for exercise, and two more for meals.'
</p>

<p><a name="SIR_WILLIAM_HAMILTON" id="SIR_WILLIAM_HAMILTON"></a>
Sir William Hamilton was the chief intellectual
influence in Edinburgh at this time, and Greg followed
his lectures with lively interest. He was still
more attracted by the controversy that then raged in
Edinburgh and elsewhere on the value of Phrenology
and Animal Magnetism. Hamilton, as all students
of contemporary philosophy are aware, denounced the
pretensions of Phrenology with curious vehemence and
asperity. It was the only doctrine, his friends said,
that he could not even tolerate. On Animal Magnetism
he held a very different opinion, and he wrote to
Greg encouraging his enthusiasm in that direction.
'There has always,' he said, 'seemed to me a foundation
of truth in the science, however overlaid with a
superstructure of credulity and enthusiasm.... I
foresee as great a clamour in favour of the science as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><a href="#TOC">[222]</a></span>
there is at present a contempt and prejudice against
it, and both equally absurd.'
</p>

<p>
It was in this field, and not in literature or philosophy,
that Greg's interests were most actively aroused
during his university career. When his life as a
student came to an end, he returned home with his
whole faculties of curiosity and enthusiasm concentrated
upon natural history, phrenology, and animal
magnetism. 'I have a canine appetite for natural
history,' he told his brother in 1828. He describes
with all the zeal of a clever youth of nineteen how
busily he is employed in macerating skulls, dissecting
unsavoury creatures before breakfast, watching the
ants reduce a viper to a skeleton for him, and striving
with all his might to get a perfect collection of animal
and human skulls. All this, however, was rather
an accidental outbreak of exuberant intellectual
activity than serious and well-directed study. He
was full of the vague and morbid aspirations of youth.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for me [he writes to his elder brother], I am pining
after change, I am thirsting for excitement. When I
compare what I might be with what I shall be, what I
might do with what I shall do, I am ready to curse myself
with vexation. 'Why had I, who am so low, a taste
so high?' I know you are rather of a more peaceful
and quiet temper of mind than I, but I am much mistaken,
if you have not much of the same desire for some
kind of life more suited to man's lofty passions and his
glorious destiny. How can one bear to know how much
is to be seen and learned, and yet sit down content without
ransacking every corner of the earth for knowledge
and wonder and beauty? And after all, what is picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><a href="#TOC">[223]</a></span>
a few skulls (the occupation which gives me the greatest
pleasure now), when compared with gaining an intimate
and practical acquaintance with all the varieties of man,
all the varying phases of his character, all the peculiarities
of his ever-changing situations?'<a name="FNanchor_223_1" id="FNanchor_223_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_1" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="footnote" style="margin-left: 5em;"><p><a name="Footnote_223_1" id="Footnote_223_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_223_1"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> August 28, 1828</p></div>

<p>
We may smile at the youthful rhetoric, as the
writer proceeds to describe how shameful it would be
to remain inactive in the sight of exertion, to be satisfied
with ignorance when in full view of the temple
of knowledge, and so forth. But it is the language
of a generous ardour for pure aims, and not the
commoner ambition for the glittering prizes of life.
This disinterested preference remained with Greg
from the beginning to the end.

William Greg's truest delight at this time lay in
his affectionate and happy intercourse with his
brother Samuel. There were three elder brothers.
One of them died comparatively young, but Robert
and John were eminently successful in the affairs
of life; the former of them represented Manchester;
they both lived to be octogenarians, and both left
behind them the beneficent traces of long years of
intelligent and conscientious achievement. In Samuel
Greg an interesting, clear, and earnest intelligence
was united to the finest natural piety of character.
Enough remains to show the impression that Samuel
Greg made even on those who were not bound to
him by the ties of domestic affection. The posthumous
memorials of him disclose a nature moulded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><a href="#TOC">[224]</a></span>
of no common clay; and when he was gone, even
accomplished men of the world and scholars could
not recall without emotion his bright and ardent
spirit, his forbearance, his humility.<a name="FNanchor_224_1" id="FNanchor_224_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The two
brothers, says one who knew them, were 'now both
of them fresh from college: their interest was alike
keen in a great variety of subjects&mdash;poetry, philosophy,
science, politics, social questions. About these
the two brothers were never tired of talking together.
They would pace up and down all the evening under
the stars, and late into the night, discussing things
in heaven and earth with a keen zest that seemed
inexhaustible. Their appetite for knowledge was
insatiable, and their outlook over the rich life that
was opening before them was full of hope and
promise.'

The energetic and high-minded mother of the
house died at the end of 1828, and the tenderness
and skill of her youngest son in the sickroom surpassed
the devotion of women. In the following
year he went to manage one of his father's mills at
Bury, where he went to reside. The Gregs had
always been distinguished for their efforts to humanise
the semi-barbarous population that the extraordinary
development of the cotton industry was then attracting
to Lancashire. At Quarry Bank the sedulous
cultivation of their own minds had always been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><a href="#TOC">[225]</a></span>
subordinate to the constant and multifarious demands
of their duties towards their workpeople. One of
the curious features of that not very distant time
was the <a name="THE_APPRENTICE_HOUSE" id="THE_APPRENTICE_HOUSE"></a>Apprentice House. The employer procured
children from the workhouse and undertook the
entire charge of them. The Gregs usually had a
hundred boys and girls between the ages of ten and
twenty-one in their apprentice house, and the care
of them was one of the main occupations of the
family. They came from the refuse of the towns,
yet the harmony of wise and gentle rule for the
young, along with dutifully adjusted demand and
compliance between the older hands and their employers,
ended in the transformation of the thin,
starved, half-dazed creatures who entered the gates
of the factory into the best type of workpeople to
be found in the district. The genial side of the
patriarchal system was seen at its best. There is
a touch of grace about the picture of the pleasant
house with its old beech-trees and its steep grassy
lawns sloping to the river, with the rhythmic hum
of the mill, the loud factory bell marking the hours
like the voice of time itself, the workers pouring
through the garden in the summer morning on their
way to Wilmslow church, and receiving flowers and
friendly salutation from the group at the open door
of the great house. It was little wonder that these
recollections acquired a fascination for William Greg
that never passed away, and gave that characteristic
form to his social ideas which they never lost.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><a href="#TOC">[226]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At Bury and at Quarry Bank the two brothers
were unresting in their efforts both to acquire knowledge
for themselves and to communicate it to their
neighbours. They delivered courses of lectures, and
took boundless trouble to make them interesting and
instructive. In these lectures William Greg took
what opportunities he could find to enforce moral
and religious sentiment. 'I lay it down,' he said,
'as an indubitable fact that religion has double the
effect on Saturday that it has on Sunday; and weekday
morality, incidentally introduced, meets with
far more attention than the tautology of Sabbath
subjects, treated in the style in which they generally
are by professed teachers.' A more questionable
diligence displayed itself in the zealous practice of
experiments in animal magnetism and mesmerism.
With a faith that might have moved mountains the
two brothers laid their hands upon all sorts of sick
folk, and they believed themselves to have wrought
many cures and wonders. William Greg described
animal magnetism as a 'discovery bearing more
immediately and extensively on the physical happiness
of the world than any which the last three
centuries have witnessed.' The cowardice of doctors
and others, who believed but were afraid to speak,
stirred all the generous fire of youth. 'Here, of
itself,' he cries out to his sister (September 4, 1829),
'is a bitter satire upon human nature, and a sufficient
answer to all who moralise on the impropriety of
flying in the face of received opinions and public
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><a href="#TOC">[227]</a></span>
prejudice. I assure you it is a knowledge of how
often the ridicule and contempt of the world has
crushed truth in the embryo or stifled it in the
cradle, which makes me so eager to examine and
support those opinions which mankind generally
condemn as visionary and irrational.' In later times
these interests became a bond between W. R. Greg
and Miss Martineau. He finally let the subject drop,
with the conviction that years of practice had brought
it no farther on its way either to scientific rank or
to practical fruitfulness. The time would have been
better spent in severer studies, though these were
not absent. From Green Bank he writes to his
sister in 1830:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sam and I are at present engaged in some calculations
on population, which have brought us to a very curious,
beautiful, and important conclusion hitherto overlooked
by all writers on the subject whom I have consulted, and
which threatens to invalidate a considerable part of
Malthus's theory. It respects the increase or diminution
of fecundity; but I will write you more fully when we have
quite established our facts. I have just finished a number
of very tedious tables, all of which confirm our conclusions
in a manner I had not ventured to anticipate....</p>

<p>I am now (September 3, 1830) very busy reading
and arranging and meditating for my lectures on history,
which will be ten times the labour of my last; also
collecting from all history and all science every fact, or
principle, or opinion, or admission, or event, which can
in any way bear upon magnetism, or suggest any argument
for its correctness, whereby I have amassed a
profusion of ancient and modern learning, which I think
will astonish the natives when I bring it forward.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><a href="#TOC">[228]</a></span>
My other occupations at present are reading through
the best authors and orators of our country&mdash;to get a
perfect command of language and style&mdash;as Hooker,
Taylor, Burke, Canning, Erskine, Fox, etc., after which
I shall take to French literature, and make myself as
well acquainted with Voltaire, Molière, Bossuet, Massillon,
Fléchier, and Condorcet, as I am with Mme. de Staël
and Rousseau and Montesquieu and Volney. This will
be work enough for another year; and what fit may
then come upon me, it is impossible to see. My views
on population are confirmed by every fresh calculation
I see, and Sadler's new work affords me the means of
controverting his theory and establishing my own. The
moral, physical, and political influence of manufactures
and Poor Laws I must next examine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little later he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything bears indications of some approaching
struggle between the higher and lower classes, and the
guilt of it, if it does come, will lie at the door of those
who, by their inflammatory speeches, public and private,
and by their constant and monotonous complaints, have
raised among the people a universal spirit of rebellion
and disaffection to everything and everybody whom
Nature has ordained to rule over them. We are all
waiting in some alarm and much indignation for the
result, and in the meantime (<i>entre nous</i>) I have written
a small pamphlet, addressed to the higher classes on the
present state of public feeling among the lower, urging
them to moderate and direct it if they can. But sooner
than the present state of things should continue, I would
adopt any principles, conceiving it to be the duty of all
men, as Burke says, 'so to be patriots as not to forget
that we are gentlemen, to mould our principles to our
duties and our situations, and to be convinced that all
(public) virtue which is impracticable is spurious.' I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><a href="#TOC">[229]</a></span>
write to induce the people to leave politics to wiser
heads, to consent to learn and not endeavour to direct
or teach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We here see that before he was one-and-twenty
years old, Greg was possessed by the conception that
haunted him to the very end. When the people
complain, their complaint savours of rebellion. Those
who make themselves the mouthpieces of popular
complaint must be wicked incendiaries. The privileged
classes must be ordained by Nature to rule over
the non-privileged. The few ought to direct and
teach, the many to learn. That was Greg's theory of
government from first to last. It was derived at this
time, I suppose, from Burke, without the powerful
correctives and indispensable supplements that are to
be found in Burke's earlier writings. Some one said
of <a name="DE_TOCQUEVILLE" id="DE_TOCQUEVILLE"></a>De Tocqueville, who afterwards became Mr. Greg's
friend, and who showed in a milder form the same
fear of democracy, 'Il a commencé à penser avant
d'avoir rien appris; ce qui fait qu'il a quelquefois
pensé creux.' What is to be said for Mr. Greg, now
and always, is that he most honourably accepted the
obligations of his doctrine, and did his best to discharge
his own duties as a member of the directing class.
</p>

<p>
He did not escape moods of reaction. The truth
seems to be, that though his life was always well filled,
he inherited rather the easy and buoyant disposition
of his father than the energy and strenuousness of
his mother, though he too could be energetic and
strenuous enough upon occasion. Both William Greg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><a href="#TOC">[230]</a></span>
and his favourite brother were of what is called, with
doubtful fitness, the feminine temperament. It was
much less true of William than of Samuel Greg; but
it was in some degree true of him also that, though
firm, tenacious, and infinitely patient, 'he rather
lacked that harder and tougher fibre, both of mind
and frame, which makes the battle of life so easy and
so successful to many men.' It may be suspected in
both cases that their excessive and prolonged devotion
to the practice of mesmerism and animal magnetism
had tended to relax rather than to brace the natural
fibre. Samuel Greg broke down at a comparatively
early age; and though his brother's more vigorous
system showed no evil results for many long years to
come, there was a severe reaction from the nervous
tension of their mesmeric experimentation.
</p>

<p>
Those who trace despondent speculations of the
mind to depressed or morbid conditions of body will
find some support for their thesis in Mr. Greg's case.
When he was only one-and-twenty he writes to his
sister (December 2, 1830):&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am again attacked with one of those fits of melancholy
indifference to everything, and total incapacity for exertion,
to which I am so often subject, and which are indeed the
chronic malady of my existence. They sometimes last
for many weeks, and during their continuance I do not
believe, among those whose external circumstances are
comfortable, there exists any one more thoroughly miserable....
For nearly four years these fits of melancholy
and depression have been my periodical torment, and as
yet I have found no remedy against them, except strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><a href="#TOC">[231]</a></span>
stimulants or the society of intimate friends, and even
these are only temporary, and the latter seldom within
my reach, and the former I abstain from partly on principle,
but more from a fear of consequences. Every one
has a thorn in the flesh, and this is mine; but I am
egotistical, if not selfish, in inflicting it upon others. I
begin to think I have mistaken my way both to my own
happiness and the affections of others. My strongest
passion has always been the desire to be loved&mdash;as the
French call it, 'le besoin d'être aimé.' It is the great
wish, want, desire, necessity, desideratum of my life, the
source through which I expect happiness to flow to me,
the ultimate aim and object which has led me on in all
the little I have done, and the much that I have tried
to do.</p>

From these broodings the young man was rescued
by a year of travel. It was one of the elements in
the domestic scheme of education that the university
should be followed by a year abroad, and in William
Greg's case it had been postponed for a season by the
exigences of business and the factory at Bury. He
went first through France and Switzerland to Italy.
At Florence he steeped himself in Italian, and read
Beccaria and Machiavelli; but he had no dæmonic
passion (like Macaulay's) for literature. 'Italian,' he
said, 'is a wonderfully poor literature in everything
but poetry, and the poets I am not up to, and I do
not think that I shall take the trouble to study them.'
When he reached that city which usually excites a
traveller as no other city on earth can excite him,
dyspepsia, neuralgia, and vapours plunged him into
bad spirits, and prevented him from enjoying either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><a href="#TOC">[232]</a></span>
Rome or his books. The sights of Rome were very
different fifty years ago from those that instruct and
fascinate us to-day. Except the Colosseum, the
Pantheon, and a few pillars covered thick with the
filth of the modern city, the traveller found the
ancient Rome an undistinguishable heap of bricks.
Still, when we reflect on the profound and undying
impression that Rome even then had made on such
men as Goethe, or Winckelmann, or Byron, the shortcoming
must have been partly in the traveller. In
truth, Mr. Greg was not readily stirred either by
Goethe's high artistic sense, or by Byron's romantic
sense of the vast pathos of Rome.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I pass my time here [he says] with extreme regularity
and quietness, not knowing, even to speak to, a single
individual in Rome; and the direction to my valet when
I start on my perambulations, 'al Campidoglio,' 'al Foro,'
forms the largest part of my daily utterances.... In a
fit of desperation I took to writing a kind of political
philosophy, in default of my poetical aim, which is quite
gone from me. It is a setting forth of the peculiar political
and religious features of the age, wherein it differs
from all preceding ones, and is entitled the <a name="GENIUS_OF_THE_NINETEENTH_CENTURY" id="GENIUS_OF_THE_NINETEENTH_CENTURY"></a><i>Genius of the
Nineteenth Century</i>. I do not know if I shall ever finish
it; but if I could write it as I have imagined it, it will
at least be entitled to come under Mr. Godwin's definition
of eloquence. That gentleman being in a company of
literati, who were comparing their notions of what eloquence
could be defined to consist in, when his opinion
was asked replied, 'Eloquence is truth spoken with fervour.'
I am going on with it, though slowly, and fill up the rest
of my leisure time with Dante and Machiavelli (with
which last author I am delighted) in the morning, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><a href="#TOC">[233]</a></span>
with Boccaccio and our English poets in the evening.

<p>
From Rome Mr. Greg and a companion went to
Naples, and from Naples they made their way to
Sicily. I have said that Mr. Greg had not Byron's
historic sense; still this was the Byronic era, and no
one felt its influence more fervently. From youth to
the end of his life, through good and evil repute, Mr.
Greg maintained Byron's supremacy among poets of
the modern time. It was no wonder, then, that he
should write home to his friends,&mdash;'I am tired of
civilised Europe, and I want to see a <i>wild</i> country if
I can.' Accordingly at Naples he made up his mind
to undertake what would be a very adventurous tour
even in our day, travelling through Greece and Asia
Minor to Constantinople, and thence northwards
through Hungary to Vienna. This wild and hazardous
part of his tour gave him a refreshment and
pleasure that he had not found in Swiss landscapes
or Italian cities, and he enjoyed the excitement of the
'wild countries' as thoroughly as he had expected.
On his return to England he published anonymously
an account of what he had seen in Greece and Turkey,
in a volume which, if occasionally florid and imaginative,
is still a lively and copious piece of description.
It is even now worth turning to for a picture of the
ruin and distraction of Greece after the final expulsion
of the Turk.<a name="FNanchor_233_2" id="FNanchor_233_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_2" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

<p>
On his return he found the country in the throes
of the great election after the Reform Bill. Perhaps
his experiences of the sovereign Demos on that
occasion helped to colour his opinions on popular
government afterwards.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>December 5, 1832.</i>&mdash;On Tuesday we nominated&mdash;there
was a fearful crowd of 10,000 ruffians, Grundy's friends
from the country. A tremendous uproar. I seconded
Mr. Walker's nomination, but was received with yells and
groans, owing chiefly to the prosecution which I have
instituted against the other candidate and four of his
supporters for intimidation of voters. The ruffians roared
at me like so many bulls of Bashan, and shook their fists
at me, whereupon I bowed profoundly; and, finding it
impossible to obtain a hearing, I turned to the opposite
candidate and his immediate supporters on the hustings
and spoke to them. When we concluded, the uproar was
fearful. I was warned to escape as I could, which I did,
amid groans and hisses, but no violence. The next
morning we started polling. I had the honour of giving
the first vote, and at four o'clock the poll was decided in
our favour&mdash;Walker, 301; Grundy, 151. The next day
I returned from Manchester, and had not been in the mill
two hours before I was summoned to assist in quelling a
riot. I rode down immediately with three other gentlemen
and a magistrate to the scene of faction. We found plenty
of broken windows and heads, but no one killed. Here
were two parties of such bludgeon men as I never before
witnessed, evidently bent on mischief. We read the Riot
Act&mdash;sent for the military and the Haslams! I rode
among the ruffians. They were in a state of extreme
exasperation, especially against me, but listened to my
exhortations, and after shaking their bludgeons at me,
came at last to shake hands. About dusk I received
several hints to take care of myself, so rode back to Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><a href="#TOC">[235]</a></span>
Bank, and lay with my blunderbuss and sword, ready to
give entertainment to any visitor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is little wonder that in a man of his literary
temperament and predispositions a strong reaction
followed close behind these energetic performances.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know [he writes, December 29], I am sick of
public life. I mean sicker than ever. The reward, or
rather success, is so very inadequate to the sacrifice; and
the exertion, and the injury to one's character, mentally,
morally, and religiously, is so great, and one's real happiness
suffers yet more. My love for retirement and the
country, scientific studies, and calm, quiet, and refreshing
society, such as the country only can afford, which has
always been a sort of passion, is now urging me more
strongly and imperiously than ever, to weigh conflicting
interests and tastes, and to hold fast that which is good.
And is it not far better to retire in the full vigour of life,
when the energy of application is still unimpaired, and can
be usefully directed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="STARTS_IN_BUSINESS" id="STARTS_IN_BUSINESS"></a>
In 1833 Mr. Greg started in business on his own
account at Bury. He inherited his father's mechanical
taste, and took a lively interest in the improvements
that were constantly being made in those years in the
wonderful machinery of the cotton manufacture.
With his workpeople his relations were the most
friendly, and he was as active as he had ever been
before in trying to better their condition. A wider
field was open for his philanthropic energies. Lancashire
was then the scene of diligent social efforts of
all kinds. Mr. Greg was an energetic member of the
circle at Manchester (Richard Cobden was another)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><a href="#TOC">[236]</a></span>
which at this time pushed on educational, sanitary,
and political improvements all over that important
district. He fully shared the new spirit of independence
and self-assertion that began to animate the
commercial and manufacturing classes in the north
of England at the time of the Reform Bill. It
took a still more definite and resolute shape in the
great struggle ten years later for the repeal of the
Corn Laws. 'It is among these classes,' he said, in a
speech in 1841, 'that the onward movements of
society have generally had their origin. It is among
them that new discoveries in political and moral
science have invariably found the readiest acceptance;
and the cause of Peace, Civilisation, and sound National
Morality has been more indebted to their humble but
enterprising labours, than to the measures of the most
sagacious statesman, or the teachings of the wisest
moralist.'
</p>

<p><a name="MARRIES" id="MARRIES"></a>
In 1835 Mr. Greg married the daughter of Dr.
Henry, an eminent physician in Manchester, and
honourably known to the wider world of science by
contributions to the chemistry of gases that were in
their day both ingenious and useful. Two years after
his marriage he offered himself as a candidate for the
parliamentary representation of Lancaster. He was
much too scrupulous for that exceedingly disreputable
borough, and was beaten by a great majority. In
1841 the health of his wife made it desirable to seek
a purer air than that of the factory district, and in
the spring of 1842 they settled in a charming spot at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><a href="#TOC">[237]</a></span>
the foot of Wansfell&mdash;the hill that rises to the southeast
above Ambleside, and was sung by Wordsworth
in one of his latest sonnets:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Wansfell! this household has a favoured lot,</span>
    <span class="i0">Living with liberty on thee to gaze,</span>
    <span class="i0">To watch while morn first crowns thee with her rays:</span>
    <span class="i0">Or when along thy breast securely float</span>
    <span class="i0">Evening's angelic clouds....</span>

    <span class="i0">From every object dear to mortal sight,</span>

    <span class="i0">How oft, to elevate our spirits, shone</span>
    <span class="i0">Thy visionary majesties of light,</span>
    <span class="i0">How in thy pensive glooms our hearts found rest.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Such a step had long been in his mind. From
Naples when on the threshold of active life, he had
written (February 6, 1832):&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am becoming more and more anxious to realise a
competence speedily, every time I look to the future, and
reflect on the true objects of life, and the likeliest means
of procuring them. I am desirous to be able to realise
the projects I have formed before the age of feeling and
acting be past, and before the energy of youth has been
evaporated by long repression. Life and talents and
desires were not given me to be wasted in a situation
where the power of doing good is at best very limited,
and where that of acquiring the higher kinds of knowledge
and enjoying the best gifts of life is still more
confined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The nearer prospect of the world of business and
actual contact with it made no change in the perpetual
refrain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><a href="#TOC">[238]</a></span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wonder [he writes, May 15, 1833] how long philosophy
or indecision will induce to continue the dog's life I am
leading here. I never open a book, but shun them as if
they were poison, rise at half-past five o'clock, go to bed
at ten, and toil like a galley slave all day, willy, nilly.
Man labours for the meat which perisheth, and the food
which satisfieth not.</p>

<p><a name="MOVES_TO_THE_LAKES" id="MOVES_TO_THE_LAKES"></a>
The move to the Lakes, though it enriched his lite
with many delicious hours, and gave him leisure for
thought and composition, yet seems to have led
directly to commercial difficulties. At first he spent
alternate weeks at Bury and at Wansfell, and for a
little time he even removed to Macclesfield. But
business fell by insensible degrees into the second
place. Mr. Greg's temperament, moreover, was too
sanguine in practical affairs, as Cobden's was; and we
might almost gather from his writings that he had
not that faculty of sustained attention to details
which is the pith and marrow of success in such a
business as his. At last the crash came in 1850.
Three years before this the health of his brother
Samuel had broken down, and William Greg added
the management of his affairs to his own. The strain
was too great, and a long struggle ended in defeat.
Both mills were closed, and the forty thousand pounds
of capital with which Mr. Greg had begun business
were almost entirely swept away. At the age of
forty-one he was called upon to begin life afresh.
The elasticity of his mind proved equal to all the
demands upon it, and they were severe. The illness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><a href="#TOC">[239]</a></span>
of his wife cast the shadow of a terrible cloud over his
house, and for long periods it was deprived of a mother,
and he of a companion. Yet amid these sore anxieties
and heavy depressions he never lost either his fortitude
or, what is much rarer than fortitude, that delicate
and watchful consideration for others which is one of
the most endearing of human characteristics. When
he was twenty years younger, he had written of himself
to one of his sisters (January 14, 1830):&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nature never cut me out for a happy man, for my
mind is so constituted as to create difficulties and sorrows
where I do not find them, and to strive with and overcome
them when I meet them. I am never so happy as
in times of difficulty and danger and excitement, and I
am afraid my line of life will furnish me with but few of
these times, so that I shall remain in the ground like the
seed of a strong plant, which has never found the soil or
the atmosphere necessary for its germination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The judgment was not an unjust one, and the
apprehension that life would bring too few difficulties
was superfluous, as most of us find it to be. When
the difficulties came, he confronted them with patient
stoicism. His passionate love of natural beauty was
solace and nourishment to him during the fifteen
years of his sojourn in that taking, happy region of
silver lake and green mountain slope. He had many
congenial neighbours. Of Wordsworth he saw little.
The poet was, in external manner and habit, too
much of the peasant for Greg's intellectual fastidiousness.
He called on one occasion at Rydal Mount,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><a href="#TOC">[240]</a></span>
and Wordsworth, who had been regravelling his
little garden-walks, would talk of nothing but gravel,
its various qualities, and their respective virtues.
The fine and subtle understanding of Hartley Coleridge,
his lively fancy, his literature, his easy play
of mind, made him a more sympathetic companion
for a man of letters than his great neighbour. Of
him Mr. Greg saw a good deal until his death in
1849.<a name="FNanchor_240_1" id="FNanchor_240_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_1" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Southey was still lingering at Greta Hall;
but it was death in life. He cherished and fondled
the books in his beloved library as if they had been
children, and moved mechanically to and fro in that
mournful 'dream from which the sufferer can neither
wake nor be awakened.' Southey's example might,
perhaps, have been a warning to the new-comer how
difficult it is to preserve a clear, healthy, and serviceable
faculty of thinking about public affairs, without
close and constant contact with those who are taking
the lead in them.<a name="FNanchor_240_2" id="FNanchor_240_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_2" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There was a lesson for the
Cassandra of a later day in the picture of Southey
when Mrs. Fletcher took tea with him in 1833.

The condition, say of Bury, in Lancashire, at that
time, contrasted with its condition to-day, is the
adequate answer to these dreary vaticinations.
</p>

<p>
One resident of the Lake District was as energetic
and hopeful as Southey was despondent. This was
Harriet Martineau, whom Mr. Greg first introduced
to the captivating beauty of Westmoreland, and
whom he induced in 1850 to settle there. Other
friends&mdash;the Speddings, the Arnolds at Fox How,
the Davys at Ambleside, the Fletchers at Lancrigg&mdash;formed
a delightful circle, all within tolerably easy
reach, and affording a haven of kind and nourishing
companionship. But, for a thinker upon the practical
aspects of political and social science, it was all too
far from&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0">Labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar.</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>
For during these years Mr. Greg did not handle
merely the abstract principles of politics and sociology.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><a href="#TOC">[242]</a></span>
A very scanty livelihood would have come by that
way. He discussed the men, measures, and events
of the day; and most of what strikes one as unsatisfactory
in the discussion is probably due to a want
of that close observation of facts which was hardly
possible to a student on the shores of Windermere.
On the other hand, it is still more certain that it
was in these meditative scenes that the germs were
ripened of those grave, ingenious, and affecting
speculations which afterwards came to their full
growth in the <i>Enigmas of Life</i>&mdash;to most of us by so
much the most interesting of all its author's performances.
His note-book shows that the thoughts that
are suggested in this short but important volume
were springing up in his mind for years, and that it
touches the problems that were most constantly
present to him in his best moments. It was during
his residence at Windermere that he worked out and
published (1851) his memorable book on the <i>Creed of
Christendom</i>. It is enough here to remind ourselves
how serious a place is held by that work in the
dissolvent literature of the generation. The present
writer was at Oxford in the last three years of the
decade in which it appeared, and can well recall
the share that it had, along with Mansel's <i>Bampton
Lectures</i> and other books on both sides, in shaking
the fabric of early beliefs in some of the most active
minds then in the University. The landmarks have
so shifted within the last twenty years that the
<i>Creed of Christendom</i> is now comparatively orthodox.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><a href="#TOC">[243]</a></span>
But in those days it was a remarkable proof of
intellectual courage and independence to venture on
introducing to the English public the best results of
German theological criticism, with fresh applications
from an original mind. Since then the floods have
broken loose. One may add that Mr. Greg's speculations
show, as Hume and smaller men than Hume
had shown before, how easily scepticism in theology
allies itself with the fastidious and aristocratic sentiment
in politics.
</p>

<p>
As was to be expected under the circumstances,
much of Mr. Greg's time was given to merely fugitive
articles on books or groups of passing events. Even
the slightest of them, so far as they are known to me,
show conscience and work. In 1852, for example,
he wrote no less than twelve articles for the four
leading quarterlies of that date. They were, with
one exception, all on political or economical subjects.
'Highland Destitution,' and 'Irish Emigration,' 'Investments
for the Working Classes,' 'The Modern
Exodus;'&mdash;these were not themes to be dealt with
by the facile journalist, standing on one foot. Mr.
Greg always showed the highest conception of the
functions and the obligations of the writer who
addresses the public, in however ephemeral a form,
on topics of social importance. No article of his
ever showed a trace either of slipshod writing or of
make-believe and perfunctory thinking. To compose
between four and five hundred pages like these, on
a variety of grave subjects, all needing to be carefully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><a href="#TOC">[244]</a></span>
prepared and systematically thought out, was no
inconsiderable piece of work for a single pen. The
strain was severe, for there was insufficient stimulus
from outside, and insufficient refreshment within his
own home. Long days of study were followed by
solitary evening walks on the heights, or lonely
sailing on the lake. In time, visits to London became
more frequent, and he got closer to the world. Once
a year he went to Paris, and he paid more than one
visit to De Tocqueville at his home in Normandy.
I remember that he told me once how surprised and
disappointed he was by the indifference of public
men, even the giants like Peel, to anything like
general views and abstract principles of politics or
society. They listened to such views with reasonable
interest, but only as matters lying quite apart
from their own business in the world. The statesman
who pleased him best, and with whom he found most
common ground, was <a name="SIR_GEORGE_CORNEWALL_LEWIS" id="SIR_GEORGE_CORNEWALL_LEWIS"></a>Sir George Cornewall Lewis.
</p>

<p>
Like most men of letters who happen to be blessed
or cursed with a prudential conscience, Mr. Greg was
haunted by the uncertainty of his vocation. He
dreaded, as he expressed it, 'to depend on so precarious
a thing as a brain always in thinking order.' In
every other profession there is much that can be done
by deputy, or that does itself, or is little more than
routine and the mechanical. In letters alone, if the
brain be not in working order, all is lost. In 1856
Sir Cornewall Lewis, who was then Chancellor of the
Exchequer, <a name="CUSTOMS" id="CUSTOMS"></a>offered Greg a place on the Board of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><a href="#TOC">[245]</a></span>
Customs, and he accepted it. Yet, as he said, he did
so 'with some loathing and great misgiving.' Five
years earlier he would have entered upon it with
eagerness, but in five years he was conscious of having
made 'sad progress in that philosophy whose root is
idleness, indulged freedom, and increasing years.'
<a name="LETTER_TO_JAMES_SPEDDING" id="LETTER_TO_JAMES_SPEDDING"></a>To James Spedding he wrote on the 24th of May
1856:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My position every one but myself seems to think
most enviable. <i>I</i> contrast Lower Thames Street with The
Craig, and my heart sinks into my shoes. The attendance
is onerous; the actual work is not. It seems to be
a place wherein a man may grow old comfortably. There
is a good salary (nominally £1200), and a liberal retiring
allowance when you are worked out. A board every
day&mdash;except for two months' holiday, varied only by
occasional tours of inspection&mdash;sounds horrible slavery
to a man accustomed to wander at his own free will;
and finally, at my time of my life, I have an indefinable
dislike to anything involving a total change of life and
habits. <i>En revanche</i>, I have a provision for old age and
for my family, and shall be almost as glad to be spared
the necessity of writing for bread&mdash;for butter at least&mdash;as
sorry to be tied out from scribbling when and where
the spirit moves me.</p>

<p>My last quarter's labours are an article on America
in the <i>National</i>, and on Montalembert in the <i>Edinburgh</i>,
and one on Macaulay in the <i>North Briton</i>, of which I am
not proud. Froude's History I have not yet seen. I hope
now, as I write less, I shall have more time for reading.
It seems to be somewhat paradoxical. By the way, is
not Carlyle sadly gone off? I met him the other day,
and he did nothing but blaspheme, and pour out a torrent
of bad language against blackguards, fools, and devils
that was appalling to listen to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><a href="#TOC">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>
On the whole, when the time came, his new employment
brought him moderate interests of its own.
What may be called the literary part of the work,
such as the drawing up of reports, naturally fell into
his hands. The necessity of working with other
people, which does not always come easily to men
accustomed to the isolation and independence of
their own libraries, he found an agreeable novelty.
Still he was not sorry when, at the end of 1864,
the chance came to him of a move to the Stationery
Office. Here he was the head of a department,
and not merely a member of a Board, and
the regulation of his hours fell more into his own
hands.
</p>

<p>
From the time when he came to London, until
his death five and twenty years later (November 1881),
his life was for the most part without any incident in
which the world can have an interest. He formed
many acquaintances according to the cheerful and
hospitable fashion of London, and he made a number
of warm and attached friends. In 1873 his wife died.
<a name="MARRIES_AGAIN" id="MARRIES_AGAIN"></a>In the following year he married a daughter of Mr.
James Wilson, well known as the fellow-worker of
Cobden and Bright in the agitation against the Corn
Laws, and as Finance Minister in India, where he
sank under the cares of his office in 1860. Mr. Wilson
had been Greg's intimate friend from the days of the
League down to the time of his death. When by
and by Mr. Greg retired from his post as Controller
(1877), he wrote:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><a href="#TOC">[247]</a></span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For myself, since I gave up office, I feel comparatively
and indeed positively in haven and peace, and with
much and rather unusual brightness and sunshine round
me, and with my interest in the world, both speculative
and practical, quite undiminished, and finding old age on
the whole cheerful and quiet, and the position of a <i>spectator</i>
by no means an unenviable one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="DEATH_OF_HIS_BROTHER" id="DEATH_OF_HIS_BROTHER"></a>
This was his attitude to the end. A heavy shock
fell upon him in the death of his brother-in-law,
Walter Bagehot (1877), that brilliant original, well
known to so many of us, who saw events and books
and men with so curious an eye.
</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="LETTER_TO_LADY_DERBY" id="LETTER_TO_LADY_DERBY"></a>
He was quite a unique man [Mr. Greg wrote to Lady
Derby], as irreplaceable in private life as he is universally
felt to be in public. He had the soundest head I ever
knew since Cornewall Lewis left us, curiously original,
yet without the faintest taint of crotchetiness, or prejudice,
or passion, which so generally mars originality. Then
he was high-minded, and a gentleman to the backbone; the
man of all I knew, both mentally and morally, best <i>worth
talking things over with</i>; and I was besides deeply attached
to him personally. We had been intimates and <i>collaborateurs</i>
in many lines for twenty-five years; so that altogether
there is a great piece gone out of my daily life, and
a great stay also&mdash;the greatest, in fact. There is no man
living who was, taken all in all, so much of me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a pensive grace about one of his last
letters to the widow of the favourite brother of earlier
days:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot let Christmas pass, dear Mary, without sending
you a word of love and greeting from us both, to all
of you of both generations. It cannot be a "merry"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><a href="#TOC">[248]</a></span>
Christmas for any of us exactly; there is so much around
that is anxious and sad, and indeed almost gloomy, and
life is passing away to our juniors. But we have still
much to make us thankful and even happy; and, as a
whole, life to those whom it concerns, much more than to
us, to most of them at least, is reasonably cheerful. At
least they are young and vigorous, and have pluck to face
the battle of years to come. We have little to do now
but watch and sympathise, and give what little help we
can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="DIED" id="DIED"></a>
Greg's own departure was not much longer deferred.
He died in November 1881.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He was not one of the fortunate beings who can
draw on a spontaneous and inexhaustible fund of
geniality and high spirits. He had a craving both
for stimulation and for sympathy. Hence he belonged
to those who are always happier in the society
of women than of men. In his case this choice was
not due, as it so often is, to a love of procuring deference
cheaply. It was not deference that he sought,
but a sympathy that he could make sure of, and that
put him at his ease. Nobody that ever lived was
less of a pedant, academic don, or loud Sir Oracle.
He was easy to live with, a gay and appreciative
companion, and the most amiable of friends, but
nothing was further from his thoughts than to pose
as guide and philosopher. His conversation was particularly
neat and pointed. He had a lucidity of
phrase such as is more common in French society
than among ourselves. The vice of small talk and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><a href="#TOC">[249]</a></span>
the sin of prosing he was equally free from; and if
he did not happen to be interested, he had a great
gift of silence.
</p>

<p>
The grace of humility is one of the supreme moral
attractions in a man. Its outward signs are not
always directly discernible; and it may exist underneath
marked intrepidity, confidence in one's own
judgment, and even a strenuous push for the honours
of the world. But without humility, no veracity.
There is a genuine touch of it in a letter which
Greg wrote to a friend who had consented to be the
guardian of his children:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no directions as to their education to give.
I have too strong a sense of the value of religion myself,
not to wish that my children should have so much of it
(I speak of feeling, not of creed) as is compatible with
reason. I have no ambition for them, and can only
further say in the dying words of Julie, 'N'en faites point
des savans&mdash;faites-en des hommes bienfaisans et justes.'
If they are this, they will be more than their father ever
was, and all he ever desired to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sentiment of the unprofitable servant was deep
in his nature&mdash;as it may well be in all who are not
either blinded by inborn fatuity, or condemned by
natural poverty of mind to low and gross ideals.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Though he took great delight in the enchanted
land of pure literature, apart from all utility, yet he
was of those, the fibres of whose nature makes it
impossible for them to find real intellectual interest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><a href="#TOC">[250]</a></span>
outside of what is of actual and present concern to
their fellows. Composition, again, had to him none
of the pain and travail that it brings to most writers.
The expression came with the thought. His ideas
were never vague, and needed no laborious translation.
Along with them came apt words and the finished
sentence. Yet his fluency never ran off into the fatal
channels of verbosity. Ease, clearness, precision, and
a certain smooth and sure-paced consecutiveness, made
his written style for all purposes of statement and
exposition one of the most telling and effective of his
day. This gift of expression helped him always to
appear intellectually at his best. It really came from
a complete grasp of his own side of the case, and that
always produces the best style next after a complete
grasp of both sides. Few men go into the troubled
region of pamphleteering, article-writing, public controversy,
and incessant dialectics, without suffering a
deterioration of character in consequence. Mr. Greg
must be set down as one of these few. He never fell
into the habitual disputant's vice of trying to elude
the force of a fair argument; he did not mix up his
own personality in the defence of his thesis; differences
in argument and opinion produced not only no
rancour, but even no soreness.
</p>

<p>
The epicurean element was undoubtedly strong in
him. He liked pleasant gardens; set a high value on
leisure and even vacuity; did not disdain novels; and
had the sense to prefer good wine to bad. When he
travelled in later life he showed none of the over-praised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><a href="#TOC">[251]</a></span>
desire to acquire information for information's sake.
While his companions were 'getting up' the Pyramids,
or antiquities in the Troad, or the great tomb
of Alyattis, Mr. Greg refused to take any trouble to
form views, or to pretend to find a sure footing among
the shifting sands of archæological or pre-historic research.
He chose to lie quietly among the ruins, and
let the beauty and wonder of the ancient world float
silently about him. For this poetic indolence he had
a great faculty. To a younger friend whom he suspected
of unwholesome excess of strenuousness, he
once propounded this test of mental health: 'Could
you sit for a whole day on the banks of a stream,
doing nothing and thinking of nothing, only throwing
stones into the water?'
</p>

<p>
The ascetic view of things was wholly distasteful
to him. He had a simple way of taking what was
bright and enjoyable in life, refusing to allow anything
but very distinct duty to interfere with the
prompt acceptance of the gifts of the gods. Yet, as
very seldom happens in natures thus composed, he
was before all things unselfish. That is to say, he
struck those who knew him best as less of a centre
to himself than most other people are. Though
thoroughly capable of strong and persistent wishes,
and as far as possible from having a character of faint
outlines and pale colours, it came to him quite naturally
and without an effort to think of those for whom
he cared, and of himself not at all. There was something
of the child of nature in him. Though nobody
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><a href="#TOC">[252]</a></span>
liked the fruits of cultivated life better&mdash;order, neatness,
and grace in all daily things&mdash;yet nobody was
more ready to make short work of conventionalities
that might thrust shadows between him or others and
the substance of happiness.
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult for me here to examine Mr.
Greg's writings with perfect freedom and appropriateness.
The man rather than the author has prompted
this short sketch. His books tell their own story.
There is not one of them that does not abound in suggestion
both in politics and in subjects where there is
more room for free meditation and the subtler qualities
of mind than politics can ever afford. Mr. Greg
is not one of the thinkers whom we can place in any
school, still less in any party. It may be safely said
of him that he never took up an idea or an opinion,
as most writers even of high repute are not afraid of
doing, simply because it was proffered to him, or because
it was held by others with whom in a general
way he was disposed to agree. He did not even
shrink from what looked like self-contradiction, so
honest was his feeling for truth, and so little faith
had he in the infallibility of sect and the trustworthiness
of system. In the <a name="ENIGMAS_OF_LIFE" id="ENIGMAS_OF_LIFE"></a><i>Enigmas of Life</i> (1875) there
is much that is hard to reconcile with his own fundamental
theology, and he was quite aware of it. He
was content with the thought that he had found
fragments of true ore. Hence the extraordinary difficulty
of classifying him. One would be inclined to
place him as a Theist, yet can we give any other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><a href="#TOC">[253]</a></span>
name but Agnostic to a man who speaks in such terms
as these?&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot for a moment <i>not</i> believe in a Supreme
Being, and I cannot for a moment doubt that His arrangement
must be right and wise and benevolent. But I
cannot also for a moment feel confident in any doctrines
or opinions I could form on this great question.<a name="FNanchor_253_1" id="FNanchor_253_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_1" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same impossibility of classification meets us in
his politics. He was certainly, in a philosophic sense,
a Conservative; he was anti-popular and anti-democratic.
Yet he was an ardent champion of the popular
and democratic principle of Nationalities; he was all
for the Greeks and Bulgarians against the Turks,
and all for the Hungarians and Italians against the
Austrians.<a name="FNanchor_253_2" id="FNanchor_253_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_2" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor had he any sympathy with the old
ordering of society as such. He had no zeal, as far as
one can see, for an hereditary peerage and an established
church. He threw himself into the memorable
battle of the Reform Bill of 1832 with characteristic
spirit and energy. His ideal, like that of most literary
thinkers on politics, was an aristocracy, not of
caste, but of education, virtue, and public spirit. It
was the old dream of lofty minds from Plato down to
Turgot. Every page of Greg's political writing is
coloured by this attractive vision. Though as anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><a href="#TOC">[254]</a></span>
as any politician of his time for practical improvements,
and as liberal in his conception of their scope
and possibility, he insisted that they could only be
brought about by an aristocracy of intellect and
virtue.<a name="FNanchor_254_3" id="FNanchor_254_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_3" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But then the great controversy turns on
the best means of securing sense and probity in a
government. The democrat holds that under representative
institutions the best security for the interests
of the mass of the community is, that the mass shall
have a voice in their own affairs, and that in proportion
as that security is narrowed and weakened, the
interests of the mass will be subordinate to those of
the class that has a decisive voice. Mr. Greg had no
faith in the good issues of this rough and spontaneous
play of social forces. The extension of the suffrage
in 1867 seemed to him to be the ruin of representative
institutions; and when that was capped by the
Ballot in 1872, the cup of his dismay was full. Perhaps,
he went on to say, some degree of safety might
be found by introducing the Ballot inside the House
of Commons. De Tocqueville wrote Mr. Greg a long
and interesting letter in 1853, which is well worth
reading to-day in connection with <i>scrutin de liste</i> and
the Ballot.<a name="FNanchor_254_4" id="FNanchor_254_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_4" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> De Tocqueville was for both. He was,
as has been said, 'an aristocrat who accepted his
defeat,' and he tried to make the best of democracy.
Greg fought against the enemy to the last, and clung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><a href="#TOC">[255]</a></span>
to every device for keeping out the deluge. He could
not get on to common ground with those who believe
that education is no sort of guarantee for political
competency; that no class, however wise and good,
can be safely trusted with the interests of other
classes; and finally, that great social and economic
currents cannot be checked or even guided by select
political oligarchies, on whatever base any such
oligarchy may rest.

Lord Grey's prescription for correcting the practical
faults revealed by experience in our present
system of representation, consisted of the following
ingredients:&mdash;the cumulative vote; not fewer than
three seats to each constituency; universities and
some other constituencies, necessarily consisting of
educated men, to have increased representation; a
limited number of life members to be introduced into
the House of Commons, the vacancies to be filled,
when not less than three had occurred, by cumulative
vote within the House itself. On all this <a name="LETTER_TO_LORD_GREY" id="LETTER_TO_LORD_GREY"></a>Mr. Greg
wrote to Lord Grey (May 28, 1874): 'I quite agree
with you that this impending danger we both foresee
might be averted, if our country would listen either
to you or to me.'
</p>

<p>
Tenderness for these truly idle devices for keeping
power in the hands of a restricted class was all the
less to be expected in Mr. Greg, as he had made a
serious study of French politics prior to 1848. Now
the Monarchy of July maintained a narrow and exclusive
franchise, and its greatest minister was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><a href="#TOC">[256]</a></span>
very type of the class from whom Mr. Greg would
have sought the directors of national affairs. If ever
there was a statesman who approached the fulfilment
of Mr. Greg's conditions, it was Guizot. Guizot had
undergone years of patient historic study; nobody of
his time had reflected more carefully on the causes
and forces of great movements; he had more of what
is called the calm philosophic mind, than any one then
eminent in literature; he overflowed with what Mr.
Greg describes as the highest kind of wisdom; his
moral pretensions were austere, lofty, and unbending
to a fault. No man of any time would seem to have
been better entitled to a place among the Wise and
the Good whom nations ought to seek out to rule over
them. Yet this great man was one of the very worst
statesmen that ever governed France. The severe
morality of the student was cast behind him by the
minister. He did not even shrink from defending,
from considerations of political convenience, the malversations
of a colleague. The pattern of wisdom and
goodness devised and executed a cynical and vile intrigue,
from which Sir Robert Walpole would have
shrunk with masculine disgust, and that would have
raised scruples in Dubois or Calonne. Finally, this
famous professor of political science possessed so little
skill in political practice, that a few years of his policy
wrecked a constitution and brought a dynasty to the
ground.

<p><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>
All these political regrets and doubts, however,
cannot lessen or affect our interest in those ingenious,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><a href="#TOC">[257]</a></span>
subtle, and delicate speculations which Mr. Greg called
<i>Enigmas of Life</i>. Though his <i>Creed of Christendom</i>
may have made a more definite and recognisable
mark, the later book rapidly fell in with the needs of
many minds, stirred much controversy of a useful and
harmonious kind, and attracted serious curiosity to a
wider variety of problems. It is at this moment in
its fifteenth edition. The chapters on Malthus and
on the Non-Survival of the Fittest make a very
genuine and original contribution to modern thought.
But it is the later essays in the little volume that
touched most readers, and will for long continue to
touch them. They are as far as possible from being
vague, or misty, or aimless. Yet they have, what is
so curiously rare in English literature, the charm of
reverie. As the author said, they 'contain rather
suggested thoughts that may fructify in other minds
than distinct propositions which it is sought argumentatively
to prove.' They have the ever seductive
note of meditation and inwardness, which, when it
sounds true, as it assuredly did here, moves the spirit
like a divine music. There is none of the thunder of
Carlyle (which, for that matter, one may easily come
in time to find prodigiously useless and unedifying);
there is not the piercing concentrated ray of Emerson:
but the complaints, the misgivings, the aspirations of
our generation find in certain pages of Mr. Greg's
book a voice of mingled fervour and <i>recueillement</i>, a
union of contemplative reason with spiritual sensibility,
which makes them one of the best expressions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><a href="#TOC">[258]</a></span>
of one of the highest moods of this bewildered time.
They are in the true key for religious or spiritual
composition, as Rousseau's Savoyard Vicar is; thought
and emotion are fused without the decorations of misplaced
rhetoric. That meditations so stamped with
sincerity, and so honestly directed to the actual perplexities
of thoughtful people, should have met with
wide and grateful acceptance, is no more than might
have been expected. Least of all can their fine
qualities be underrated even by those who, like the
present writer, believe that, ponder these great
enigmas as we may, we shall never get beyond
Goethe's majestic psalm:&mdash;
